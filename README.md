## DogGooo

**Description**:
- *What will the application do?*  
DogGooo is a mobile application that allows dog owners to easily find dog-friendly places within their location. The 
application allows users to view the locations based on its category, add a pet-friendly location, edit the location 
and delete the location.

- *Who will use it?*  
Dog owners who want to bring their dog out and verify if a location is pet-friendly.

- *Why is this project of interest to you?*  
I am a new dog owner, and I am trying to bring my puppy out with me more often. There has been an experience where I 
wanted to bring my dog to a boutique but was stopped by an employee. There were no clear signs online and in the store
indicating if the store did not allow dogs. 
Hence, I want to create this application to give users a sense of reassurance and convenience if they want to bring 
their dog outside with them. I believe that this application will also encourage dog owners to bring their dogs out 
often and prevents any guilt/worry of leaving them at home.

## User Stories

*In the context of an address book application*:
- As a user, I want to be able to add the location details of a pet-friendly location to my address book 
- As a user, I want to be able to view the list of pet-friendly locations on my address book  
- As a user, I want to be able to delete a pet-friendly location from my address book
- As a user, I want to be able to view the location details of a specific location name
- As a user, I want to be able to save my address book to file
- As a user, I want to be able to load my address book from file

Phase 4: Task 2
- Included a checked exception in Location for valid phone number. Location class in the Location constructor.
  Phone number must contain only numbers and have to contain 10 digits.

Phase 4: Task 3
- I think in the GUI, I would like to have refactored the constants I have declared to prevent code duplication.
